=====================================

This repo was originally created for a talk to the San Diego .Net User Group in April 2013

The code was then improved for a similar talk on RWD at the San Diego SoCal Code Camp Conference in July 27, 2013.
A News page was also added to the repo as part of this talk/demo.
